# 📈 ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

This project showcases how to apply the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast values in a time series dataset using Python. It walks through the entire forecasting pipeline—starting from data preprocessing and stationarity checks to model tuning, fitting, and performance evaluation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Forecasting time series data is crucial in many fields such as finance, economics, operations, and environmental science. This project demonstrates how to:
- Transform raw time series data into a stationary format,
- Select optimal ARIMA model parameters using ACF and PACF plots,
- Fit the model using `statsmodels`,
- Generate forecasts and evaluate performance using error metrics and visual diagnostics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Understand the basic concepts behind ARIMA modeling.
- ✅ Convert non-stationary data into a stationary time series.
- ✅ Apply statistical tests to check for stationarity (ADF test).
- ✅ Determine appropriate model orders (p, d, q) using ACF/PACF.
- ✅ Fit and forecast with the ARIMA model.
- ✅ Evaluate forecast accuracy visually and statistically.

## 🧠 Theoretical Background

**ARIMA(p, d, q)** is a classical statistical model where:
- `p` is the number of autoregressive terms (AR),
- `d` is the number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity (I),
- `q` is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation (MA).

The model is best suited for univariate time series data that show patterns over time and can be made stationary through differencing.

## 📈 Workflow Summary

### 1. Load & Visualize Time Series
- Import data and parse date columns as index.
- Plot raw time series for exploratory insights.

### 2. Test for Stationarity
- Apply the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test.
- If p-value > 0.05, apply differencing until stationarity is achieved.

### 3. Identify ARIMA Parameters
- Use **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** and **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)** plots to estimate:
  - `p`: lag value from PACF
  - `q`: lag value from ACF
  - `d`: number of differences from ADF test

### 4. Model Building
- Fit the ARIMA model using `ARIMA` from `statsmodels`.
- Plot fitted vs actual values.

### 5. Forecasting & Evaluation
- Perform in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting.
- Use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **visual plots** to assess accuracy.

## 📊 Sample Output

- ACF and PACF plots to guide parameter selection
- Time series line plot: actual vs. predicted
- Forecast plot with confidence intervals
- MSE printed for model performance

## 🔬 Key Learnings

- Time series must be stationary for ARIMA modeling.
- ACF and PACF are vital tools for identifying appropriate model parameters.
- Model evaluation should combine statistical error metrics and visual inspection.
- ARIMA is sensitive to overfitting and requires careful tuning.

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Extend to **SARIMA** for seasonal data.
- Automate order selection using `auto_arima` from the `pmdarima` library.
- Compare ARIMA performance with LSTM or Prophet models.
- Implement walk-forward validation for more robust testing.
